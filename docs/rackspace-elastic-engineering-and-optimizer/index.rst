Advanced Monitoring and Resolution
-----------------------------------

Built for customers' critical workloads and always vigilant 24x7x365, our team
of operations engineers monitors and responds to alerts in customer
environments. Advanced Monitoring and Resolution (AMR) is an optionated
deployment of cloud services monitors that act as an extension of customer
operational teams by providing automation where possible and human actions for
activities that are beyond automation.

With Rackspace Technology acting as an extension of your 24x7 operational team,
you can focus on what matters most to your business.

AMR services
^^^^^^^^^^^^

AMR provides real-time monitoring and alerting for your cloud environment. An
expert team of operations engineers monitors and responds to any alerts in your
environment. Rackspace Technology has the breadth of knowledge required to
operate the most complex cloud deployments on a global scale. By combining with
the Rackspace Elastic Engineering service, you gain the peace of mind that comes
with having an environment cared for by a team of cloud-certified operations
engineers that help drive continuous innovation.

AMR includes:

- Optionated deployment of cloud services monitoring using known best-practices
- 24x7x365 monitoring coverage backed by cloud experts 
- Improved resolution timelines by leveraging Rackspace Technology automation 
- Guidance for a default list of alerts and thresholds, which we can customized to meet customer needs 
- On-going support to adjust monitoring as the customer environment grows

.. note::

  AMR requires (:ref:`optimizer`) or (:ref:`optimizer_platform`) as a prerequisite.

.. _vm_management:

VM Management
-------------

VM Management (VMM) is a simple, full-featured tool that makes your most critical and time-consuming
server tasks easy to complete. Built to be multi-cloud, VMM manages your VMs wherever they are located
through a simple interface and billed on a consolidated invoice. Set up your cloud the way you want
and then proceed with your migrations, transformations, and new development activities.

VMM complements Rackspace Elastic Engineering by removing critical but distracting workloads so you
can focus your resources on building your next-generation infrastructure.

Services
^^^^^^^^

VMM is currently in Limited Availability (LA). Descriptions of all services are subject to change. In
LA, VMM provides patching, and in subsequent releases, it might include backup services for multi-cloud
infrastructures. VMM also provides the following services:

* Reporting
* Support
* API and UI access through the Rackspace Technology Control Panel

Patching
^^^^^^^^

VMM provides standard baseline patching. Customers can create custom patch baselines, patch
groups, and maintenance windows to adhere to their own patching strategy. The API makes all
of these services available for customization.

Best practices for each Operating System (OS) define the patch baselines, but we customize
them to fit customer needs.

In addition, customers can inject their own customization for patching to enable process
interruptions like reboots, non-standard package downloads, and so on.

.. _optimizer:

Optimizer+

performance and saves money. Depending on customer spend, cost optimization efforts can include
the following activities:

* Access to CloudHealth, which is the leading multi-cloud management platform designed to drive
  increased business value at every stage of your cloud journey.
* Initial cost optimization review
* Cost guidance
* Architecture reviews
* Tagging strategy reviews

  hierarchical (to a more senior engineer or the service delivery manager) or functional
  (involving specialized technical expertise from other functional groups or partner cloud teams).
* Escalate to a technology or service vendor in the event of an incident.
* Offer advice about the appropriate workaround to restore service.
* Provide customers the opportunity to confirm issue resolution before closing the ticket.

We handle cloud platform escalations with the restoration of Services as the primary objective.
